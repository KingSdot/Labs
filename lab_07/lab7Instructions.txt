||Lab 07 Pointers and Dynamic Memory Allocation||

Description -
For one class you group defined in the previous lab, develop a program (C++ project) that includes:
1. Header file (.h)
2. Source file (.cpp)
3. App file (main.cpp)

(a) Define at least one default pointer object and one specified pointer object;
(b) Output all the data member values of the two pointer objects respectively;
(c) Update at least one feature of the two pointer objects;
(d) Output all the data member values of the two pointer objects after the above updates
respectively.
