Enter a number: 12

A brave group of 12 set out on a quest -- in search of the lost treasure of the Ancient Dwarves. The 
group was led by that legendary rogue, Dawson. Along the way, a band of marauding ogres ambushed the 
party. All fought bravely under the command of Dawson, and the ogres were defeated, but at a cost. Of 
the adventurers, 5 were vanquished, leaving just 7 in the group. The party was about to give up all hope. 
But while laying the decreased to rest, they stumbled upon the buried fortune. So the adventures split 900 
gold pieces. Dawson held on to the extra 4 pieces to keep things fair of course.
