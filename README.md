this repo is a collection of the different labs/coding assignments from my data structures and algorithms course at York College
the name of this course is CS291

the code is free for you to take and use as you please and many of the files may be undocumented and have little comments within them to explain the functionalities...

also, this was my first time using github so I didn't realize that making one repo for multiple different projects(labs) would get pretty messy pretty fast and that
it would make it harder for people going through my repo to understand the flow and what happens in what order when looking at the commit history, I apologize for this, however,

good luck!
