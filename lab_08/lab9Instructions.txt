||Lab 08 Pointer Array||

For the Soldier class we have been explored in class, develop a program 
(C++ project) that can compute the soldiersâ€™ average weight and include:

1. Header file (.h)
2. Source file (.cpp)
3. App file (main.cpp)

    - Define at least three soldiers of default values and two soldiers of 
    specified values by using one pointer array
    - Output all the data member values of the soldiers respectively
    - Output the average weight of all the soldiers
    - Deallocate the spaces assigned to the pointer array
